Unresolved:
1. Point Light Tile culling fails to handle edges of geometry. 
	- create a point light not entirely covering the geometry. 
	  tile artifact will show on the edge

2. Press ESC will crash the program. Whereas click to close will not carsh the program.
3. Currently mouse over gui cannot be detected. Thus, control on gui will disable the manipulator.
4. setting position from GUI doesn't update the manipulator;
5. Geometry picker bug, crash the program: (randomly, wtf!) 
	- reproduce: pick an object, click on a different manipulator type. 
	- ! Question is: change mode by key press 'g' 'r' 's' does not crash the program!!!!!!! (wtf!)

6. Linked to 1) due to osgCameraManipulator, managing projection matrix is very tricky. I added
   allow modify camera project mode in the gui editor. When enabled, the compute_near_far is disabled 
   But even though the near far value did not change, the light culling artifact will appear, meaning that
   1) in inheritedly linked to project matrices and near far plane. 

Fixed:
1. Scrolling will crash the program (TwGUI)
2. Skybox overriding preserved near far plane of gbuffer projection matrix, 
   causing gbuffer linear depth wrong, making shading buffer light culling wrong, 
   thus causing shading wrong. 
   Fixed by add an option in EffectCompositor to not presering near and far plane
   for skybox.
3. After pressing playgame, the object is still draggable and resizable;

TODO: click close renderer needs to close the game entirely.
