Unresolved:
1. Point Light Tile culling fails to handle edges of geometry. 
	- create a point light not entirely covering the geometry. 
	  tile artifact will show on the edge

2. Press ESC will crash the program. Whereas click to close will not carsh the program.

Fixed:
1. Scrolling will crash the program (TwGUI)
